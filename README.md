# CS601_FINAL_PROJECT_CHIEN
## BU METCS Fall 2 semester, 2024
1. This project is meant to be the term project, and also a portfolio to show case what was learned in the class.
2. Home page, is a brief description of my personal experience / resume.
3. At the bottom of the "experience" section is the link to the rest of the React project.
4. The React project features a fake groery store inventory list in card layout.
5. User can click detail to see each item's complete info, and edit them.
6. In the "Add Item" tab, user can add new item to the store inventory list.
7. In the "Organize" tab, user can have a quick view of where all the items are, and rearrange them quickly thru drag and drop style mechanic.
8. All data entered and changed for the inventory items will save across different tabs and pages, as long as the user don't refresh the page.
9. "Location" tab shows use of Geolocation API and embedded Google Map iframe.  No API key was used, so feature is limited to just showing where a location is.  I added a straight line distance between user location and Meta HQ location.
10. "Contact" tab features a simple contact form in Typescript.  Since there is no backend, the form does not actually send out email.
